Answers and Explanations 
Question 1 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). Encoding failure refers to the brain's occasional inability to  create a memory link. This happens for a number of reasons, with trauma being the most  common cause. An encoding failure prevents the brain from creating and storing new  memories. 
Question 2 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). The serial position effect is the tendency of a person to recall  the first and last items in a series more easily than the middle items in a series. 
Question 3 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). A heuristic is a mental shortcut that helps us make decisions  and judgments quickly and efficiently. However, the efficiency of a heuristic comes at a  cost as they are also prone to errors. 
Question 4 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Overextension is the usage of a categorical term, like "doggie,"  to describe everything similar to the object being described. In this case, Sophia is  extending the concept of "dog" to include animals that do not fit in the "dog" category. 
Question 5 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). Maslow's hierarchy of needs from lowest to highest (base to top of pyramid): physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and finally  self-actualization. 
Question 6 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). Phonemes are the smallest structural units of sound, regardless  of meaning. Morphemes, on the other hand, are the smallest meaningful units of sound. 
Question 7 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). The Whorf hypothesis holds that language patterns play a  dominant role in shaping thoughts and behavior. 
Question 8 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). A robin is considered the prototypical bird because it possesses  most features that are held by most birds. 
Question 9 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Changes in the framing of a scenario can influence decisions. In  this case, Jose responded favorably to both forecasts, but his decision was different based  on the framing of the forecast. The chance of rain is the same in both forecasts, but  because of the wording used by the meteorologist, Jose decided differently in each case.  This is an example of the framing effect. 
Question 10 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Reliability is a measure of the ability to replicate the test in  subsequent administrations. Reliability is often determined by a correlation coefficient.  The closer the correlation coefficient is to ?1 or 1, the more reliable the test is. 
Question 11 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Noam Chomsky used the term, "universal grammar" to  describe the innate language rules he suggested to explain language learning. 
Question 12 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). A phoneme is the smallest structural unit of speech. This means  that it is the smallest unit of speech that affects what word you hear. Phonemes may not  possess meaning on their own, unlike morphemes, which represent the smallest unit of  meaningful sound. 
Question 13 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). Bill's rule of thumb is a heuristic, which helps him reach a solution efficiently. Heuristics are distinguished from the less efficient (but more accurate)  algorithms. Heuristics are commonly thought of as "shortcuts." 
Question 14 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). In a confirmation bias, we seek out information that confirms  our pre-held beliefs and ignore information that misaligns with those beliefs. 
Question 15 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). If an individual fails to discriminate whether a fact was part of  an original event or part of a subsequent discussion, he or she might be experiencing  confusion about the source of the event. This source confusion then leads to an inability  to accurately describe the original event in question. 
Question 16 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Framing effects describe how the phrasing of a problem  influences the decision that is reached. In this case, even though the outcome is the same,  framing the surgery in a positive light using the word "success" results in a more  agreeable surgery than the same surgery described as failing 50% of the time. 
Question 17 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Some psychologists have hypothesized that the detail of  flashbulb memories are the result of a different brain system for emotional events, but  others argue that many of the details are inaccurate and the ability to easily recall these  events is more a result of retelling the story with some level of consistency over time  (rehearsal) instead. 
Question 18 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). These are the two most prominent explanations of forgetting.  Decay theory suggests that memories are forgotten with mere passage of time, while  interference theory suggests that memories are only forgotten when displaced by new  memories. 
Question 19 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Mary's score in the 87th percentile means that 87 percent of  those taking the test were equal to or below her.
