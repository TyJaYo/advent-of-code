Answers and Explanations 
Question 1 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). There are two areas of the hypothalamus that control hunger,  the lateral hypothalamus and the ventromedial hypothalamus. The lateral hypothalamus,  when stimulated, causes the feeling of hunger. If the lateral hypothalamus is destroyed,  an organism will no longer experience the feeling of hunger. Destruction of the  ventromedial hypothalamus results in an ongoing feeling of hunger, even after eating. 
Question 2 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). Self-esteem is determined by a number of factors, the largest  of which is social acceptance. It is a person's evaluation of self worth. 
Question 3 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (A). The Schachter-Singer theory, or two-factor theory of emotion,  describes emotion as a combination of 2 factors. According to the theory, emotion begins  with a physical arousal before the arousal is cognitively labeled. 
Question 4 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). While body posture, hand gestures, music and dance, and tone  of voice vary across different cultures and countries, facial expressions are universally  understood in their expression of emotion. 
Question 5 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Anorexia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating  disorder characterized by self-starvation, excessive weight loss, fear of weight gain, an  extreme desire to be thin, and poor body image. Regardless of physical appearance,  sufferers of anorexia believe themselves to be overweight.

Question 6 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). When the sympathetic nervous system activates, commonly  called the 'fight-or-flight response,' it is accompanied by a number of physiological  manifestations, including the slowing of digestive processes, designed to help the  organism survive the emergency. 
Question 7 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (A). An external eater is one who becomes motivated to eat after  being exposed to the sight or smell of food. 
Question 8 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). If an animal has deficient levels of leptin, or if the brain fails to  recognize leptin, the negative feedback system that normally causes the animal to stop  eating will fail. As a result, the animal will eat excessively and is likely to develop obesity. 
Question 9 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (E). Incentive theory is based on the idea that behavior is primarily  extrinsically motivated. It argues that people are more motivated to perform activities if  they receive a reward afterward, rather than simply because they enjoy the activities  themselves. In this case, Sabrina's good behavior is motivated, or incentivized, by the $20  reward for each good grade. 
Question 10 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Homeostasis refers to the tendency to restore internal  conditions to an original baseline. Homeostasis is the process of returning to the original  balance. In this case, when a person experiences cold, there is an internal drive to seek  warmth and return to homeostasis. 
Question 11 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (A). Catharsis relates to the draining of one's negative emotions, in  this case anger, by venting or "blowing off steam."
