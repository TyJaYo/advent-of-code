Answers and Explanations 
Question 1 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). Predictive validity refers to a test's ability to predict an  outcome in some other area. Since the student's scores on the teacher's tests were very  different from her scores on the AP Exam, the teacher's tests failed to accurately predict  the student's performance on the AP Exam and therefore lacked predictive validity. 
Question 2 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C) . Howard Gardner described multiple intelligences, including  interpersonal intelligence which refers to the ability to understand other people and  interact well with them. People who demonstrate high levels of interpersonal intelligence  are generally good communicators with high levels of empathy. These characteristics  would be very helpful to a psychotherapist. 
Question 3 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Aptitude refers to the potential ability to learn something a  person hasn't already learned. For example, a person with speed, strength, good  eye-hand coordination, and quick reflexes would have an aptitude for learning to play 

baseball, and would learn it quickly even though they have never played before. 
Question 4 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (A). Reliability refers to the consistency of scores on an assessment.  If the participants' scores varied a lot from one administration to the next, the researcher  would conclude that the assessment lacked reliability. 
Question 5 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Intelligence tests are normed so that 100 always indicates an  average score. 
Question 6 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (B). Stereotype threat occurs when people who know that others  who share their demographic characteristics ( gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) are expected to  do poorly on a particular assessment experience a decrease in their scores on that  assessment. 
Question 7 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). Intelligence scores fall in a normal distribution. In a normal  distribution, approximately 34% of scores fall within one standard deviation above the  mean and another 34% fall within one standard deviation below the mean. The mean  score for intelligence is 100 and the standard deviation is 15 points. Therefore, a score of  85 would be one standard deviation below the mean and a score of 115 would be one  standard deviation above the mean. So 34% of people's scores would fall between 85 and  100 and another 34% would fall between 100 and 115. When these are added together,  the result is 68%. 
Question 8 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). Cattel described 2 types of intelligence: crystallized intelligence  which is accumulated knowledge and vocabulary, and fluid intelligence which is the  ability to reason abstractly and solve novel problems. 
Question 9 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (C). When Terman began his study in 1921, there was a widespread  belief that people who were gifted as children would be more likely to grow up to have  problems in adulthood ("first to ripe, first to rot"). Terman wanted to show that this was  not the case. Although none of his 1528 "Termites" grew up to win the Nobel Prize, they  grew up to be better educated and more successful on average than their nongifted  peers. 
Question 10 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). In a normal distribution, if the mean is 80 and the standard  deviation is 12, then a score of 92 would fall one standard deviation above the mean. In a  normal distribution about 84% of scores would fall below one standard deviation above  the mean, leaving 16% at or above one standard deviation above the mean. Therefore, 

since a 92% is one standard deviation above the mean in this scenario, 16% of the scores  would be at or above a 92% 
Question 11 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (D). To calculate IQ using the Stanford-Binet formula, divide Mental  Age by Chronological age, then multiply by 100. 11.5 divided by 10 = 1.15. 1.15 x 100 =  115. To double check your answer, remember that 100 is an average score. So if the  mental age is higher than the chronological age, you should get an answer that is above  100. 
Question 12 Explanation: 
The correct answer is (A). The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The  square root of 16 = 4.
