This best illustrates: ","Sensory adaptation ","Accommodation ","Transduction ","Gate Control Theory ","Just-noticeable difference ","Neural adaptation or sensory adaptation is a change over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as a change in the stimulus "
"What is the process by which we recognize, interpret, and organize our sensations? ","Perception ","Sorting ","Sensation ","Threshold ","Transduction ","Perception is the process of recognizing, responding to, and interpreting sensory stimuli. "
"What are the two types of receptors in the eye? ","Cones and rods ","Disks and rods ","Cones and poles ","Rods and poles ","Disks and cones ","Inside of the retina are two types of photoreceptors, rods and "
"What carries information for the rods and cones back out to the ganglion cells and then to the brain? ","Bipolar cells ","Afferent neurons ","Glial cells","Optic nerve ","Temporal lobe ","Signals received by the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) are transmitted to the ganglion cells by way of bipolar cells.

"Pete is looking at a number of circles on a piece of paper. When he views the circles from one angle, the circles look like craters.

What is the source of this change in his perception of the circles? ","Light and shadow ","Convergence ","Linear perspective ","Relative position ","Texture ","Gradients of light and shadow create the perceptual phenomenon of bumps and craters; the change following rotation is due to prior knowledge about the most likely source of light (from above). "
"Of the following, which is a monocular cue for depth perception? ","Interposition ","Accommodation ","Assimilation ","Convergence ","Retinal disparity ","Interposition refers to the interpretation of depth due to one object covering another.

What explains this phenomenon? ","Linear perspective","Closure ","Motion parallax ","Phi phenomenon ","Texture gradient ","Distance perception in a two-dimensional representation of a railroad track is primarily a function of linear perspective. Linear perspective is responsible for the perception of two parallel lines intersecting at a single point. "
"In another two-dimensional picture of a railroad track, a small object is perceived by a person as a train. This is an example of which of the following? ","Size constancy ","Accommodation ","Closure ","Continuity ","Motion parallax ","When an object far in the distance is perceived as a large object instead of its presentation as a small object, size constancy is taking place. In this case, the small object is perceived to be a train due to the surrounding context. "
"""Umami"" is defined as: ","A neurotransmitter present in the neuromuscular junction ","A small membrane separating parts of the ear ","A sex hormone ","A species of chimpanzee distantly related to humans ","One of the five basic tastes, sensed by a specialized receptor on the human tongue. ","Lights blinking in sequence and perceived as movement are an example of the phi phenomenon. Strobe lights elicit the phi phenomenon. "

This feedback arises by way of which sense? ","Olfactory ","Cerebellar ","Kinesthetic ","Sixth ","Vestibular ","Specialized receptor cells respond to various external stimuli such as touch, light, temperature, pressure, etc. These receptor cells transduce the physical stimulus into electrical impulses, which, in turn, trigger an impulse in other cells. Transduction is the process of converting signals or stimuli from one form to another. "
"A picture of 2 distinct arrows, <??> and >??<, are perceived to be of different lengths even though they are not. What is this illusion called? ","Zeller illusion ","Haagen-Dazs illusion ","King illusion ","Klein illusion ","Müller-Lyer illusion ","In the Japanese language, Umami means savory. The umami receptor on the tongue is activated by glutamate in protein-rich foods. "
"In the 1800s, Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz proposed a theory of perception. With what is the Young-Helmholtz theory concerned? ","Pitch perception ","Color perception ","Depth perception ","Encoding ","Size vs. shape ","The difference threshold is the smallest difference that a person can detect between two stimuli. In this case, every tone from 1,100 Hz to 1,149 Hz is perceived as the same. "
